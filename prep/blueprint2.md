# Blueprint for a 4-Day Intensive TypeScript Course

**Course Title:** TypeScript Fundamentals in 4 Days

**Instructor:** Joseph Opio

---

## Course Description

This intensive four-day workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to TypeScript, a powerful typed superset of JavaScript. Over four one-hour lessons, participants will transition from foundational concepts to more advanced features, enabling them to write more robust, scalable, and maintainable code. The course is designed for developers with a working knowledge of JavaScript who want to leverage the benefits of a statically typed language. Each session will include theoretical explanations and practical examples to solidify understanding.

---

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, objects, arrays, etc.).
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) installed.
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed to set up a TypeScript environment.

---

## Course Objectives

By the end of this four-day course, participants will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts and benefits of TypeScript.
- Set up a TypeScript development environment.
- Utilize basic and complex types to create strongly typed variables and functions.
- Work with interfaces and classes to build structured and object-oriented code.
- Implement advanced TypeScript features like generics and utility types.

- Allowing a variable to be one of several types (Union).
- Combining multiple types into one (Intersection).
- Type narrowing with `typeof` and `instanceof`.
- **Hands-on:** Writing a function that accepts a union type and performs different actions based on the type.

#### Q&A and Wrap-up (5 minutes)

- Review of classes, enums, and advanced types.
- Preview of Day 4.

### Day 4: Generics, Utility Types, and Final Review

**Objective:** To understand how to write reusable, type-safe code with generics and leverage built-in utility types.

#### Generics (25 minutes)

- Introduction to generics for creating reusable components.
- Generic functions and interfaces.
- Generic constraints to limit the types that can be used.
- **Hands-on:** Creating a generic function that can work with different data types while maintaining type safety.

#### Utility Types (20 minutes)

- Overview of commonly used utility types: `Partial<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, `Pick<T>`, `Omit<T>`.
- Practical examples of how utility types can simplify your code.
- **Activity:** Using utility types to create new types from existing ones.

#### Course Review and Next Steps (15 minutes)
